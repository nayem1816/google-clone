# Google Clone

A website that functions as a clone of the Google search engine would mimic the functionality and interface of Google's search engine. Users would be able to enter keywords or phrases into a search bar, and the website would return a list of relevant web pages and information based on those keywords. The website would likely use a similar algorithm to Google's to generate these results, and may also incorporate other features such as image and video search.
